			Tyronn Lue is asking his Cavaliers players for patience as he sifts through how to utilize the considerable talent on the roster after a clunky showing in the team's 102-99 season-opening win Tuesday. Yes, Lue wants the Cavs to be in better shape and play faster. Sure, he'd like to see more 3s taken (22) and made (five) than Cleveland posted against the Celtics. Dwyane Wade shot 3-of-10 and committed four turnovers. Kyle Korver didn't take a shot in seven minutes. Derrick Rose took 14 shots and tallied just two assists. J.R. Smith played well off the bench against the Celtics (10 points, four rebounds), but couldn't play down the stretch because of a stiff back. Lue said he "forgot" Thursday when asked whose spot Smith might've taken had his back held up in the fourth quarter, as a way to avoid answering a sticky question.
